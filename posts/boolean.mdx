## Boolean Expressions

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value. The six relational operators in Java are:
- **`==`** : equal to
- **`!=`** : not equal to
- **`>`** : greater than
- **`<`** : less than
- **`>=`** : greater than or equal to
- **`<=`** : less than or equal to

For example, to check if two numbers are equal:

~~~java
int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 7;
if (num1 == num2) {
    System.out.println("The numbers are equal.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The numbers are not equal."); // prints this
}
~~~

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine Boolean expressions and return a Boolean value. The three logical operators in Java are:

- **`&&`** logical AND
- **`||`** logical OR
- **`!`** logical NOT

For example, to check if a number is between 1 and 10:

~~~java
int num = 5;
if (num >= 1 && num <= 10) {
    System.out.println(num + " is between 1 and 10."); // prints this
} else {
    System.out.println(num + " is not between 1 and 10.");
}
~~~

## Boolean Variables

Boolean variables are variables that can only have the value true or false. They are often used to store the result of a Boolean expression. The basic syntax for declaring a Boolean variable is:

~~~java
boolean varName;
~~~

For example, to declare a Boolean variable and assign it the value of a Boolean expression:

~~~java
int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 7;
boolean isEqual = num1 == num2; // isEqual = false
System.out.println("The numbers are equal: " + isEqual);
~~~

## Short-Circuit Evaluation

Short-circuit evaluation is a feature of logical operators in Java that can improve program performance. When evaluating a logical expression using the **`&&`** or **`||`** operators, Java only evaluates the second operand if necessary. For example, if the first operand of a logical AND expression is false, then the entire expression is false regardless of the value of the second operand. In this case, Java does not evaluate the second operand. Similarly, if the first operand of a logical OR expression is true, then the entire expression is true regardless of the value of the second operand.

## If, Else-if, and Else Statements

If/else if/else statements are used to execute different code blocks based on different conditions. The syntax for an if/else if/else statement is as follows:

~~~java
if (condition1) {
    // code block 1
} else if (condition2) {
    // code block 2
} else {
    // code block 3
}
~~~

For example, to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero:

~~~java
int num = 5;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive."); // prints this
} else if (num < 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is negative.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
}
~~~

### Nested If/Else expressions

Nested if/else expressions are used when there are multiple conditions that need to be evaluated in a hierarchical manner. In a nested if/else statement, there is an outer if/else statement that contains an inner if/else statement.

For example, to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using nested if/else statements:

~~~java
int num = 5;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive."); // prints this
} else {
    if (num < 0) {
        System.out.println("The number is negative.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The number is zero.");
    }
}
~~~

## Equivalent Expressions with DeMorgan's Law

DeMorgan's Law is a rule in logic that describes how to negate an expression. In Java, DeMorgan's Law can be used to express a Boolean expression in an equivalent form. Some basic rules are:

- **`!(a && b)`** equal to **`!a || !b`**
- **`!(a || b)`** equal to **`!a && !b`**
- **`!(!a)`** equal to **`a`**
- **`!(a == b)`** equal to **`a != b`**
- **`!(a != b)`** equal to **`a == b`**
- **`!(x < 0)`** equal to **`x >= 0`**
- **`!(x > 0)`** equal to **`x <= 0`**
- **`!(x <= 0)`** equal to **`x > 0`**
- **`!(x >= 0)`** equal to **`x < 0`**

For example, to express the negation of AND using DeMorgan's Law:

~~~java
int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 7;
if (!(num1 > 0 && num2 > 0)) { // num1 <= 0 || num2 <= 0
    System.out.println("At least one number is negative or zero.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Both numbers are positive."); // prints this
}
~~~

## Comparing Objects

In Java, objects can be compared using the **`.equals()`** method. The **`.equals()`** method returns true if the two objects have the same content, and false otherwise. It is important to note that the **`.equals()`**s method is not the same as the **`==`** operator, which checks if two objects are the same instance.

For example, to compare two string objects:

~~~java
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";
if (str1.equals(str2)) { // == checks the memory location, not value of String
    System.out.println("The strings are equal.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The strings are not equal."); // prints this
}
