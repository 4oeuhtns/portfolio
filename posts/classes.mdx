## Anatomy of a Class

A class in Java is made up of attributes (also called instance variables), methods, and constructors. Attributes are declared using the private keyword, which restricts access to only the declaring class. Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object's attributes. Methods can be both public and private, and are used to operate on an object's attributes. Data encapsulation and implementation of a class are hidden from outside the class. Accessor and mutator methods allow the use and modification of data.

### Constructors

Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object's attributes. Constructor parameters are local variables to the constructor and set instance variables. If no constructor is written, Java provides a no-argument constructor, and instance variables are set to default values.

### Documentation

Comments in Java can be single-line ( **`//`** ), multiline ( **`/* */`** ), or Javadoc ( **`/** */`** ). Javadoc comments are used to create API documentation. Use comments to describe functionality and document preconditions and postconditions. Precondition comments describe conditions that must be true before a segment of the program can be executed. Postcondition comments describe conditions that are true after a segment of the program has executed. Programmers write method code to satisfy postconditions when preconditions are met.

### Accessor and Mutator Methods

Accessor methods are used to get the value of instance or static variables. Mutator methods are used to set the value of instance or static variables. Accessor methods are non-void and return a copy of the value. Mutator methods are often void methods with parameters.

### Writing Methods

Methods can define the behaviors of an object. It is possible to pass objects into methods. Do not modify mutable objects that are passed in, as this will change the original object. When the parameter is a primitive, the formal parameter copies the value. When the parameter is a reference to an object, the formal parameter copies the reference. Passing in a reference results in the formal parameter and the actual parameter referring to the same object.

An example of a method that passes in an object is:

~~~java
public boolean isSameBreed(Dog otherDog) {
    return breed.equals(otherDog.breed);
}
~~~

## Static Variables and Methods

Static means associated with the class, not the object. Static methods include a static header before the method name. Static methods cannot access instance variables but can access and change static variables. They do not have a "this" reference. All objects of a class share a single static variable, which can be either public or private and is designated with the static keyword before the variable type.

## Scope and Access

Local variables are declared within the body of a method or constructor and can only be used within that method or constructor. Local variables cannot be declared public or private. If a local variable has the same name as an instance variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable instead of the instance variable. Programmers can solve large problems by splitting them into subproblems and creating methods to solve each subproblem.

## The "this" Keyword

Within a non-static method or constructor, "this" refers to the current object. "this" can be used to pass the current object as a parameter in a method call.
