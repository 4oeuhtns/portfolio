## Recursive Methods

A recursive method is a method that calls itself. It provides an elegant way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller problems of the same type. In general, a recursive method has two parts: the base case and the recursive case.

### Base Case and Recursive Case

- The **base case** is the stopping condition of the recursion. It is the case in which the method returns without calling itself.
- The **recursive case** is where the method calls itself with smaller inputs, moving towards the base case. Each recursive call has its own set of local variables, different from other calls. Parameter values track recursion, similar to loop control variables.

Recursion can be replicated with iteration, but it is often easier and more intuitive to use recursion in situations that call for it. However, recursion can lead to infinite recursion, resulting in a stack overflow. Therefore, it is important to make sure that the base case is well defined and that the recursion will eventually end.

## Laws of Recursion

1. A recursive method must call itself.
2. A recursive method must have a base case.
3. A recursive method must move towards the base case each time it is called.

## Tracing Recursion

Tracing a recursive method involves keeping track of each call in a stack trace. When a recursive method is called, the parameters and local variables for that call are added to the stack. Each subsequent call is added to the top of the stack. Once the base case is reached, the method returns, and the call is removed from the stack. The previous call can then resume execution. One way to think about it is like a stack of books: you add a new book to the stack until you reach the base case, which is when you start taking books off the stack until there are no books left.
